  [Back to Roadmap](README.md)
  

 > ### 1. Self-learning takes practise
 > Approach it like any other new skill. Push yourself just above your upper limit **consistently** and you will get better. Start slow, don't burn yourself out. Gradually increase how long you study for and consider looking into different study methods (ie. Pomodoro Technique, etc)
 >
 > ### 2. Be realistic
 > There are too many topics to learn absolutely everything in a reasonable amount of time. Please use [this repository](https://github.com/Developer-Y/cs-video-courses?tab=readme-ov-file) to make any changes to fit your own personal goals. Study what interests you, not what you think is required for a job!
 >
 > ### 3. Embrace failure!
 >
 > Self-learning isnt as easy as simply finding a free online course from a good university, and blitzing right through it. **You will encounter problems**. 
 > - Some study methods didn't work for me, so I tried others.
 > - I didn't like how some modules were taught, so I looked for others. 
 > - I didn't like the contents of certain modules, so I looked for others. 
 > Regardless of how "good" a course is, or how "effective" a study method is; do what is best for **you**!

### Layout
  Each year is split into 3 terms, which should each last around 12-16 weeks.

  For each term, try to spend around 8 hours per week on each module. \
  They usually consist of ~2 hours of lectures a week, but also have problem sets and recitations, as well as the final project/exam.

  Try make your own study plan, it should include space for:
  - Lectures
  - Problem Sets/Assignments
  - Recitations
  - Breaks   !!!!
  - Work on Project
  - Recap of the Week
  


 Try to diversify what you're learning. For example, if two of your modules are focussing heavily on maths, spread them apart.
