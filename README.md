# Self-Taught Robotics Roadmap

This is meant to be a little less overwhelming than other roadmaps out there.


> ### 1. Self-learning takes practise
> Approach it like any other new skill. Push yourself just above your upper limit **consistently** and you will get better. Start slow, don't burn yourself out. Gradually increase how long you study for and consider looking into different study methods (ie. Pomodoro Technique, etc)
>
> ### 2. Be realistic
> There are too many topics to learn absolutely everything in a reasonable amount of time. Please use [this repository](https://github.com/Developer-Y/cs-video-courses?tab=readme-ov-file) to make any changes to fit your own personal goals. Study what interests you, not what you think is required for a job!
>
> ### 3. Embrace failure!
> Self-learning isnt as easy as simply finding a free online course from a good university, and blitzing right through it. **You will encounter problems**. 
> - Some study methods didn't work for me, so I tried others.
> - I didn't like how some modules were taught, so I looked for others. 
> - I didn't like the contents of certain modules, so I looked for others. 
>
> Regardless of how "good" a course is, or how "effective" a study method is; do what is best for **you**!

For each term, try to spend around 8 hours per week on each module. They usually consist of around 2/3 hours of lectures a week, but also have problem sets and recitations, as well as the final project/exam.

After each lecutre, I recommend writing a short summary of what you've learned as if you were teaching it to someone else.

	> Approach these courses similar to a usual module - i.e., devote time each week to watching topics (lectures), doing problem sets and recitations on previous topics.
- Project: Develop a Dynamic web application
	- *Blog platform*: users can sign up, create posts and interact with others' content
	- *E-Commerce Website*: build a small e-commerce site with product listings, a shopping card and user accounts
	- *Portfolio Website*: design a personal portfolio website showcasing your skills and projects.
